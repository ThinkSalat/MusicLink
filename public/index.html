          The first hip-hop crew signed to the <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/search/label%3A%22Sub+Pop%22">Sub Pop</a> label, Shabazz Palaces is the brainchild of Ishmael "Butterfly" Butler, although the <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gqIrDRL7CEPBWMmkuZPdQ">Digable Planets</a> member wasnâ€™t so quick to admit it. </div>
          <div class="bio-secondary">In 2009, Shabazz Palaces released two EPs -- one self-titled, the other titled Of Light -- but Butler's name didn't appear on either. No promo shots, no social networking sites, no interviews, and no press releases were issued by the enigmatic, Seattle-based project, but that didn't stop the local press from throwing praise at these EPs, which hit much harder than <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gqIrDRL7CEPBWMmkuZPdQ">Digable</a> while retaining that forward-thinking wordplay. The EPs became favorites at the <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/search/label%3A%22Sub+Pop%22">Sub Pop</a> offices, too, and in 2010, the usually indie rock label signed the project, releasing their debut album, Black Up, in 2011. Next, it transpired that Tendai Maraire -- son of the famous mbira player Dumisani Maraire -- was responsible for most of the instrumentation on that record and that Shabazz Palaces was, in effect, a duo.</div>

            <div class="expand-body">
              <div class="bio-secondary">Both Butler and Maraire were relatively quiet in the ensuing years, but found time to make a guest appearance on AwE NaturalE, the 2012 debut by fellow Seattle alternative hip-hop duo <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3H1MzPCZZQ0SKoKQlTNfqa">THEESatisfaction</a>. The pair also teamed up with Hussein Kalonji to create the March 2014 album riZe vadZimu riZe under the <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/484SvKmzcXc5df6mT5GOQ3">Chimurenga Renaissance</a> moniker, before they returned that same year with a second Shabazz Palaces studio album, Lese Majesty. Three years later, in 2017, they returned with two further albums, Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star and Quazarz vs the Jealous Machines; both albums chronicled the journey of Quazarz, a celestial being trying to navigate the harsh reality of life on Earth. ~ David Jeffries & James Wilkinson, Rovi
